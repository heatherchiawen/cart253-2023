The Age of Aquariums

For this exercise I tried created a wave like display in the background using "Nutritious felling" by rapley in the p5js library. https://editor.p5js.org/rapley/sketches/BK_8BfvDk I made slight alterations in attempt to make the waves look more 2D.

Throughout my coding of this program, what I found most difficult was creating different properties and functions that corresponded to the objects in the array allowing for said object to act or look differently from each other. I attempted to resolve this by going into the createFish function to add random() to a variety of properties that would effect the objects size and shape. 

Skimming a few weeks ahead to the object oriented programming module, I found "the magic forumla" that helped move the fishes in different directions. With this skimming, I found a more indepth tutorial on timers (module 8) to which I implemented so that there could be two ending states. 

Using code found in the array module helped set up the program but also to elimnate fish from the aquariums when the user clicks on top of the fish. 

Aditionally and lastly, I found somethings that didn't work for my program. One of which was creating an array of colours that would allow fish to stay one singular colour thorughout the program. Another was condensing the text states to be called in one function, as the console log could not read "message" when in a displayText function.
