Juggle Garden Exercise, CART 253
Heather Chester, 40215280

This exercise uses the garden, bees, and flowers created from the Object Oriented Programming module with the objective to practice working with object interactions and input in OOP.

For the font, I used "Great Vibes, cursive," from Google Fonts. 

As the requirements were to add a form of user control, new classes and objects, and at least two endings, I created a user control that held two classes so that the user would have two objects to choose from that could be associated with different functions. Additionally, to create two states, I used the code from the last exercise, Age of Aquariums, to create a timer that would run the duration of the simulation. From the same exercise, I used the object timer function to have new bees appear periodically thorugout the simulation.  

As far as integrating new functions into the various classes goes, I found limitations with what I could do with event handlers and furthering them. I found that event handlers that contained for loops, using splice(), or break; proved to be hard to manage or not work at all. This activity definitely felt like a big learning curve, and I would have liked to add more event handlers and make the appearance look different but alas, because of the overall learning curve, time did not permit. Nevertheless, it was a fun exercise and I belive that I can improve upon adding event handlers in project 2.
