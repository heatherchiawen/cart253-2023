CART 253, Project1/Snakes & Ladders Simulation 
Heather Chester, 40215280
  
This is a simulation inspired by the popular board game, Snakes and Ladders. In this simulation, the user is initially restricted to running along the bottom of the canvas, avoiding falling snakes that will send the user back to the starting position. Ladders moving across the screen allow for the user climb the ladder, advancing toward to finish line. If the user doesn't climb the ladder, they will be taken to end of the screen, which will end the game.

For some personal notes on the program, I tried out some new functions and methods like; classes, vertexes, curve(), and switch states. Although I did not end up using some of these functions/methods, I found using classes instead of java objects helped me control the mutiples of snakes and ladders that were appearing and create collision checks for each of the appearing snakes and ladders. I also believe that using classes also assited in cleaning up my code for this simulation. On another note, I decided to create a retro aesthtic for the game and followed through with pixelated-style font and pixelated gifs. 

If I was to further this program, I would add floating buttons to restart the simulation, a timer, and levels that would control how many snakes and ladders appear on the screen and not to mention some fun easter eggs.

Followed Xin Xin's Youtube tutorial "8.3 Switch Statement - Changing Scenes!" (https://youtu.be/cxppa6dNzxE?si=l4crMc1F6dAu_8ps) and "8.4 Class and Objects - Collision Detection" (https://youtu.be/cZ_VHAT_Sq4?si=_xzcAeE9sruBWWUB)to create classes. 

For displaying the finish line, I applied the code examples from "for statements" in the "4.4 loops" document on Pippin Barr's CART 253 course website. 

For displaying static I used the lines of code used in one of the previous assignments, "03-movingpictures".
