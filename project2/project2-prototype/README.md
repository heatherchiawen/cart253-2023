# Project 2 prototype 

Here is a simple prototype for Project 2. While this is on a much smaller scale than what is intended, I hope this provides a rough idea for how I plan on furthering this project. 

Please see the proposal pdf for more info on how I plan on moving forward with this project. 

Please note that the code for the audio visualizer was adapted from NishƒÅn Wickramarathna, "Audio Visualization in JavaScript with p5.js," on Medium, May 2, 2020.  https://nishanc.medium.com/audio-visualization-in-javascript-with-p5-js-cf3bc7f1be07
